Detailed Change log:
--------------------

Version 5.0.3.3 (Stable version - Jul 5th 2011)
-----------------------------------------------
  * Linux: Allow installation to a different directory (for cross-compilation mainly).
  * Workaround firmware bug: if no depth, IR timestamps are corrupt. Use host clock for timestamps instead.
  * Bug Fix: unregistering USB event callback when destroying sensor to prevent crash when unplugging device.
  * XnExportedSensorDevice now only enumerates devices that weren't created in the context yet.

Version 5.0.2.3 (Stable version - May 3rd 2011)
-----------------------------------------------
  * Fixed use of deprecated CreateProductionTree().
  * Bug Fix: playing XNS files in applications using deprecated API might cause memory leaks.
  * Bug Fix: serial number was in hex format instead of decimal one.
  * Make sure SensorV2 nodes will only use SensorV2 device (up to now they only checked it's a PrimeSense device).

Version 5.0.1.33 (Unstable version - Apr 18th 2011)
---------------------------------------------------
  * CE4100: adding support in makefiles, redist and install.
  * CE4100: default is now BULK with compressed formats.
  
Version 5.0.1.32 (Unstable version - Apr 11th 2011)
---------------------------------------------------
  * Fixing log prints of resolutions (-1 appeared as MAX_UINT64...) to the resolution name.
  * Linux Bug Fix: Server creates two log files, one in the client folder and one in /var/log/primesense/XnSensorServer
  * Fixed a memory leak when rewinding old XNS files.
  * Win32: WIX installer (replacing NSIS)
  * Fixed wrong version in XnDeviceFile

Version 5.0.1.31 (Stable version - Apr 11th 2011)
-------------------------------------------------
  * Fix BULK timeout - it was too small...
  * Bug Fix: IR only works in QVGA...
  * Added 64bit support for the installers.
  * Fix wrong uses of the XN_IS_STATUS_OK macro (value is evaluated twice).
  * Adding support for MJPEG pass-through.
  * Adding initial support for new CMOS interfaces
  * Adding initial JPEG support
  * Fix for UAC installer problems.
  * Fixed uninstall without OpenNI.
  * Set minimum OpenNI version check in the installer.
  * Fix seeking to first frame in old XNS files.
  * Bug Fix: Client would fail to connect if trying to connect while server is shutting down.
  * Improving the timestamps algorithm.
  * performance improvement when enumerating for image nodes - a sensor should only be checked once.
  * improving error message for setting grayscale8 in low resolutions.
  * Improve thread-safety when starting server
  * Bug Fix: a crash when trying to open a non-existing XNS file.
  * Bug Fix: a potential crash if Init of depth generator fails.
  * Sensor now supports the Device Identification capability.
  * Server: fixing a deadlock problem between closing a stream and getting new data from it. This was done by splitting the sensor lock into two locks: one for changes on the sensor and one for changing the stream collection.
  * MultiProcess Bug Fix: the lock on a sensor didn't exist, so nothing was synchronized.
  * ImageGenerator now also changes InputFormat when changing resolution if needed (when switching from hi-res to normal & vice versa).
  * Adding frame IDs to Audio (just counting)
  * restoring defaults to QVGA.
  * Add support for sensors with no image CMOS.
  * Updated low-bandwidth USB devices buffer information.
  * Added the Asus WAVI auto-detection for Win32.
  * Low bandwidth devices now use bigger USB delays.
  * New defaults are now VGA, uncompressed.
  * Initial support for low-band devices:
    1. Image, IR and audio does not enumerate.
    2. Defaults changed to QVGA, compressed.

Version 5.0.0.25 (Unstable version - Jan 6th 2011)
--------------------------------------------------
  * Bug fix: infinite loop in server when a client tries to disconnect and streams can't be closed (usb timeout for example).
  * Added MacOSX platform support.
  * Added the unstable README file.
  * Removed useless win32 prerequisites...
  * Fixing audio to work properly in the client-server model.
  * Server Bug Fix: a potential dead lock was solved.
  * Sensor Server now supports multiple sensors. 
  * Refactored server to a better design, which should decrease deadlocks and make code more readable.
  * Adding support for enumerating and opening different sensors.
  * Bug Fix: GetStringProperty would always return XN_STATUS_ERROR.

Version 5.0.0.24 (Stable version - Dec 8th 2010)
------------------------------------------------
  * Initial release...
